Some doctors in NTHC are not convinced in telemetery
	- what is the value?
One way to address
	- demo often and quickly
	- feedback from last meeting
		- NTHC is signing deal to deploy CHITS
		- why not try to connect with that as well
		- slightly different model
		- challenge: figure out triage in rxbox to fit with CHITS
		-
CHITS
	- version now is not to be used
	- deal will start next year
	
CHITS Demo
	- what does it do?
		- electronic record
		- replace mano-mano tara system of health centers
			- logs during delivery of service
			- then compile in a report
		- eliminates "pagbibilang ulit"
	- not fully integrated with DOH
	- DOH does not endorse, actually they make their own
	- started in 2004, pasay
	- 3 out of 14 remaining in pasay
	- 3 in Tarlac
	- 50+ all over the country
	- MOA with QC (72 health centers and super health centers)
	- PHP, Linux Apache PHP, MySQL
	- since web based
	- 1 server, 2 clients
		- 1 client in records section
		- 1 client at treatment root, where drugs are disseminated
		- server at Doctor consultation
	- Family folder
		- family : group of patients in a household
		- add family address
		- indicate head of family (required by DOH)
	- Records
		- patient info
		- patient group : service to avail
		- see physician?
		
	- Where does telemetry go in?
		- can be a module
			- clinical result
		- vital signs
		- graphs
		- labs
	
	- no CHITS technical documentation yet
	
	- para di na kailangan magmarket, para connected sa system
	- chits is not telemedicine
	- Message handler (middleware of triage)
	- chits is front in health center
	- then add modules
	- still use message handler, triage
	
	- http sessions
	- login, then visit modules using URL
	- review PERL
	
	- is it possible to do a mock up to present to Portia?
	
	
	- kaya naging successful ang CHITS, kasi nasama sa workflow yung developer, nagagawa agad ang problems
	- just to change the look is not enough
	- designed to be a seemless, painless transition
	- same as a paper record
	
next steps
	- propose
		- how to add telemetry to this one
	
inside github
	- in modules/history
		- MVC is in 1 file (class)

how would you (Randy) consider plugging-in rxbox?
	- BP ready?
		- in hardware, send bp
	- pag naclick ang vital signs, possibly may button

mock up
	- powerpoint
	
are there any revisions?
	- database
		- planning to put openmrs as backend
		
would there be value, if mobile/tablet?
	- in pasay, a dentist uses iphone
	
connect current(previous) thesis
	
add android as db client



extras
- ang midwives ay lumalabas sa health center para pumunta sa bahay-bahay
- madaming stages bago ma-field test ang isang device
